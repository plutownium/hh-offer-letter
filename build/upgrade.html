      <div><p class="svelte-15ipdet">It means you get the opportunity to increase your compensation by tens of thousands of

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You’ll be able to do this not just once, but over and over throughout your career.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You’ll leave your peers and colleagues in the industry in the dust monetarily.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">How?</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">By following <span class="underline">a set of proven methods and techniques that hundreds of recruiters could tell you about</span>…
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">But none will.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Because improving your job hunting and negotiation abilities would be bad for their
          clients.
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">They don’t want you to improve.</p>

        <p class="underline svelte-15ipdet">In fact, recruiters and employers celebrate giving employees the short end of the stick in
          salary negotiations.
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">However, I’m here to help.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">To tell you: It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You don’t have to continue as an underpaid, undervalued member of your team for the rest
          of your career.
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You don’t have to disappoint yourself, year after year, by failing to secure a raise from
          your employer.
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Or by avoiding the discussion entirely.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The difficulty in securing a raise is not your doing. Society rigs the game against you,
          and the only place you have to turn to for advice is the Internet.
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Yet the Internet isn’t always helpful!</p></div>
      <div class=""><h2 class="text-jet text-3xl svelte-15ipdet">Millions of people are underpaid. You shouldn’t feel bad about it, but you should try to
          fix it.
        </h2></div>
      <div><p class="svelte-15ipdet">If the Internet&#39;s advice on this topic is so common, why does the question come up over
          and over on Reddit?
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Shouldn’t Redditors be able to solve this so well that the search function is all anyone
          needs?
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Here’s typical Redditor advice you’ll receive about what to do when you’re underpaid:</p>

        <div class="mt-4"><img src="/images/img00a.png" alt="A reddit post that reads: Interview with other companies to find out what your labor is actually worth"></div>
        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The advice shows up again in this thread:</p>

        <div class="mt-4"><img src="/images/img01.png" alt="Am I being underpaid at my current job?"></div>

        <div class="mt-4"><img src="/images/img02.png" alt="A reddit post that reads: Best way to find out is to apply to new roles & see what you get offered"></div>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The reason this advice shows up so often is that it works.</p>
        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Yet the advice is popular and common, so it’s “factored in” to your job search.</p>
        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Said a different way: You can’t get extraordinary results by doing ordinary things.</p>
        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">It’s the bare minimum. You’re already doing it! So the advice won’t get you to the top
          10%.
        </p>
        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Even when people do apply the Internet’s advice, they often come up short…</p>
        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Because their job hunting and interview skills often need work.</p>
        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You can’t find better job offers if you can’t get to the interview stage… or make
          interviewers love you as a candidate.
        </p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Here’s another redditor echoing this same truth:</p>

        <div class="mt-4"><img src="/images/img03.png" alt="A reddit post that reads: You are only worth what someone is willing to pay you"></div>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Yet none of these posts address the glaring, valley-wide room for improvement:</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Your job hunting and interview skills.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">If they’re weak, you’ll end up with the same low pay as you had before.</p>

        <p class="svelte-15ipdet">And nothing will change.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

      <h3 class="text-2xl svelte-15ipdet">But we’re back to the same issue! If your skills are sharp, yet your offers don’t reflect
        what you feel you’re worth…
      </h3>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">What are you to do?</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The way it is now, <span class="underline">there’s no one on your team on this issue except you and me</span>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl svelte-15ipdet">I’ll tell you how it really is:</h2>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You’re underpaid because <span class="text-orange font-bold">the entire system</span> is setup
        to hold you back from being well paid to the best of its ability.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Your boss wants your pay to be low.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Recruiters want your pay to be low.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Other companies want your pay to be low.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">All of them have one thing in common:</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">They’re out to help themselves, not you.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">So how can you get ahead when everyone is trying to hold you back?</p>

      <h2 class="text-center text-blue font-bold text-4xl svelte-15ipdet">You need to have an in-the-know IT recruiter who’s <span class="underline">on your side</span>.
      </h2>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You’ll learn a lot of hidden gems of wisdom that only experienced recruiters could tell you.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Lots of them could tell you these secrets but won’t.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">I’m the exception.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">My 9-5 involves watching 30 companies make hiring decisions every single week.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">I see who they hire… and who they don’t.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">I see the patterns.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The stories.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The case by case example of what an in-demand candidate does and doesn’t do.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Yet I’m willing to help you.</p>

      <p class="font-bold svelte-15ipdet">Because helping someone change careers and go from $40,000/year to $100,000/year is
        satisfying.
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold svelte-15ipdet">Because helping someone go from $90,000/year to $130,000/year means I sleep great that
        night.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Last year I helped someone go from $20k to $90k. Felt great.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">In fact, I have so much to tell you that I can give away lots of advice <span class="underline">for free</span> and still have more to tell you after you invest.

    <div><p class=" svelte-15ipdet">If the free advice is good, what&#39;s the full service like?</p>
      <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Tip #1</span>: Use a two or three page resume.
      </h3>

      <div class="mt-4"><img class="" src="/images/img09.png" alt="A Headhunter tweet that says: 'Of the 50 candidates I've placed in the last year, exactly one had a single page resume.'"></div>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The “It has to fit on one page” advice is bullshit.</p>
      <p class="font-bold svelte-15ipdet">Of the fifty candidates I helped get hired this year, 49 of them used a two or three page
        resume.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The truth is that <span class="underline">if you use a one page resume, employers will presume that’s all you had to offer</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Are you using a one page resume right now?</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">So long as you follow the next tips, you’ll see an improvement by adding a second page.
        (Supposing you don’t adhere to them already, anyway.)
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Tip #2</span>: Use a simple low-design approach.
      </h3>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">While you don’t want to present a document with zero formatting, making the resume flashy is
        also the wrong approach.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Recruiters will throw out a resume that looks flashy before they even read it.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You want your features and benefits to stand on their own.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The design takes attention away from the bullet points.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">So by using low-design, you allow the bullet points to “speak for themselves.”</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Tip #3</span>: Use language from the job post you are applying to.
      </h3>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">It takes far more time, but the upside is huge: Recruiters will recognize</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Your application really was crafted specifically for that posting.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Your skills really match exactly what they asked for.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Without your application matching the job post’s language…</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The recruitment team has to do a lot of thinking to understand how you’d fill the role.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">When you use language that matches the job post, they understand exactly:</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">“Oh yeah, s/he would be able to fulfill requirements X, Y and Z.”</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">That means you’ll get more interviews.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">That means you’ll be in demand.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">That means you’ll be offered more money.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Tip #4</span>: Using specific detailed bullet points that are
        quantified.
      </h3>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">If you aren’t in the habit of doing this, it will take work to start doing it.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">But…</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">It will be well worth the effort.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Don’t say</span>: “Reduced call time from the database.”</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Do say</span>: “Reduced call time from the database by 37% by
        decreasing read algorithms from O(nlogn) to O(n).”
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Don’t say</span>: “Decreased page load speed by converting to
        Tailwind, yielding a decrease in the bounce rate.”
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet"><span class="underline">Do say</span>: “Decreased page load speed by 48% by converting from
        CSS to Tailwind, yielding a 26% decrease in the bounce rate.”
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Similar to Tip #2, the issue is that the vague option leaves recruiters to fill in the
        blanks themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">(And they don’t fill them in. Because it would take effort and require presumptions.)</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">By telling them specifically, quantifiably, what you changed during your previous roles, you
        go from…
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">“Meh, not sure what this means.”</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">To…</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">“Wow, that would be such an improvement here.”</p>
      <p class="font-bold svelte-15ipdet">These tips work and work well.</p>
      <p class="font-bold svelte-15ipdet">Applying them will get you a better response rate immediately.</p>
      <p class="font-bold svelte-15ipdet">But you’ll get far further by investing in getting the full Headhunter treatment.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">If these tips are “all you need,” I wish you the best…</p></div></div></div></div>

    <div><p class="svelte-15ipdet">First, let’s address who this is not for:</p>

      <li class="mt-4 svelte-15ipdet">You’re convinced your resume and job hunting skills have to be “perfect” to land a pay

      </li>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">You don’t have to be perfect but you do have to follow the advice you receive. If you’re

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Were I to advise you on how to do your job, you would be right to ignore me.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">But if I advise you on how to acquire your job, my advice is the best of the best.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">So if your ego is too big to acknowledge that I know better than you on this topic, this

      <li class="mt-4 svelte-15ipdet">You think you know better than a recruiter about what does and doesn’t work.
      </li>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Same story as above. You have to be prepared to execute on the advice you receive.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">If you don’t, my advice won’t work.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">I speak to, on average, 12 companies *per week* and have an inside look at what they REALLY
        care about. I’ll tell you exactly what the candidates who get the most offers have in common
        on their resumes.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Rate yourself out of 10 at whatever you do. Whatever your rating really is, I’ll add four
        points to how you are perceived via my resume advice.
      </p>

      <p class="question-text text-blue svelte-15ipdet">Q: Will I be able to implement the advice properly?</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">All day long at my day job, I coach candidates that I think are winners into presenting
        themselves well to employers. I guarantee I can help you make a big improvement to your job
        searching skills that will add 10 to 50% to your compensation.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">If it doesn’t work for you, you can take the full amount off the cost of my Done For You
        service.
      </p>
      <p class="question-text text-blue svelte-15ipdet">Q: Will this work even if I can’t negotiate?</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">This guide will show you proven, tested strategies for negotiating.</p>
      <p class=" svelte-15ipdet">You’ll receive the <span class="underline">exact strategies and techniques</span> for negotiating
        a higher salary companies can’t counter.
      </p>
      <p class="question-text text-blue svelte-15ipdet">Q: Will the guide won’t work even when the economy is bad?
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">When the job market takes a dive, top earners continue to receive the highest compensation
        in the marketplace. <span class="underline">Being good at job hunting, selling yourself and negotiating means that you’ll be paid
          well regardless of how the market is doing</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="question-text text-blue svelte-15ipdet">Q: What if I’m not good enough at my job to earn more money? What if I haven’t worked hard
        enough to earn a raise?
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">I’ll tell you directly that this belief is a huge part of why you’re underpaid.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">High paid employees recognize that <span class="underline">while hard work does pay off, it isn’t the only variable that decides compensation</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The other variables include:</p>
      <ul><li class="svelte-15ipdet">How well their boss and coworkers like them.</li>
        <li class="svelte-15ipdet">Whether they present well in interviews.</li>
        <li class="svelte-15ipdet">How directly the work they produce makes the company money.</li>
        <li class="svelte-15ipdet">Whether decision makers perceive their contributions as valuable or not.</li></ul>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet"><span class="italic">So even if you’re a slacker</span>, you can still use this advice to
        earn more money.
      </p>
      <p class="question-text text-blue svelte-15ipdet">Q: What if the company can’t afford to give me a raise?</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Your company spends millions of dollars a year on labor. You can estimate this value by
        taking the number of people in your office and multiplying it by your current salary.
        Whether you have 5 coworkers or 50, it’s going to be a number so large that an additional
        $20,000 won’t be noticed.
      </p>
      <p class="question-text text-blue svelte-15ipdet">Q: Could I get this advice from another recruiter?</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Nope. Recruiters serve their clients, namely the company will help rip you off. Recruiters
        won’t and don’t tell you the secrets you can only get here.

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">I should be pricing this at $1,500.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">The return on the investment will be 20x that amount. (A $30,000/year increase divided by

      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Keep in mind:</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">That 30% will stay with you year after year.</p>

      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Suppose you change roles 2-3x over ten years, securing a $30,000 pay increase each time. By
        year 6 you’ll be earning an additional $60,000 per year.

        guide to a hundred people every month.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">That puts a severe limitation on how many are able to invest. It’s true.</p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Yet I also want to avoid employers “seeing it coming” by recognizing these successful
        techniques when they first see them.
      </p>
      <p class="svelte-15ipdet">Since you wouldn’t get much value out of it if every employer could counter these
