        <p>How?</p>

        <p>
          By following a set of proven methods and techniques that hundreds of recruiters could tell
          you about…
        </p>

        <p>But none will.</p>

        <p>
          Because improving your job hunting and negotiation abilities would be bad for their
          clients, they don’t want you to improve.
        </p>

        <p class="underline">
          In fact, recruiters and employers celebrate giving employees the short end of the stick in
          salary negotiations.
        </p>

        <p>However, I’m here to help.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to continue as an underpaid, undervalued member of your team for the rest
          of your career.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to disappoint yourself, year after year, by failing to secure a raise from
          your employer.
        </p>

        <p>Or by avoiding the discussion entirely.</p>

        <p>
          The difficulty in securing a raise is not your doing. Society rigs the game against you,
          and the only place you have to turn to for advice is the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>Yet the Internet isn’t always helpful!</p>

        <p>If advice on this topic is so common, why does the question come up over and over?</p>

          Shouldn’t Redditors be able to solve this so well that the search function is all anyone
          needs?

        <p>The advice shows up again in this thread:</p>
        <!-- // todo: insert image -->

        <p>
          The reason this advice shows up so often is that it works. But even when people apply,
          they often come up short. Job hunting and interview skills often need work.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can’t find better job offers if you can’t get to the interview stage… or make
          interviewers love you as a candidate.
        </p>

        <p>Here’s another redditor echoing this same truth:</p>

        <!-- // todo: insert image -->

      <p>
        You feel undervalued and know it’s true. You find yourself pinching pennies when you never
        thought you’d have to. Friends and people on forums say your pay should be higher. You want
        to be the type of person who can brag and help others get ahead. But you don’t know how to
        make a change.

        You post a yearly “here’s my TC” and find yourself leading the pack on Team Blind. You offer

        You’re underpaid because the entire system is setup to hold you back from being well paid to
        the best of its ability.
      </p>

      <p>Your boss wants your pay to be low.</p>

      <p>Recruiters want your pay to be low.</p>

      <p>Other companies want your pay to be low.</p>

      <p>All of them have something in common: They’re out to help themselves, not you.</p>

      <p>Lots of them could tell you these secrets but won’t.</p>

      <p>I’m the exception.</p>

      <p>My 9-5 involves watching 30 companies make hiring decisions every single week.</p>

      <h2>Four Free Ways to Improve Your Resume Today</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3><span class="underline">Tip #1</span>: Use a two or three page resume.</h3>

      <!-- todo: hh tweet img -->

      <p>The “It has to fit on one page” advice is bullshit.</p>
      <p class="font-bold">
        Of the fifty candidates I helped get hired this year, 49 of them used a two or three page
        resume.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is that <span class="underline"
          >if you use a one page resume, employers will presume that’s all you had to offer</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>Are you using a one page resume right now?</p>
      <p>
        So long as you follow the next tips, you’ll see an improvement by adding a second page.
        (Supposing you don’t adhere to them already, anyway.)
      </p>
      <h3>Tip #2: Use a simple low-design approach.</h3>

      <p>
        While you don’t want to present a document with zero formatting, making the resume flashy is
        also the wrong approach.
      </p>
      <p>Recruiters will throw out a resume that looks flashy before they even read it.</p>
      <p>You want your features and benefits to stand on their own.</p>
      <p>The design takes attention away from the bullet points.</p>
      <p>So by using low-design, you allow the bullet points to “speak for themselves.”</p>
      <h3>Tip #3: Use language from the job post you are applying to.</h3>

      <p>It takes far more time, but the upside is huge: Recruiters will recognize</p>
      <p>Your application really was crafted specifically for that posting.</p>
      <p>Your skills really match exactly what they asked for.</p>
      <p>Without your application matching the job post’s language…</p>
      <p>The recruitment team has to do a lot of thinking to understand how you’d fill the role.</p>
      <p>When you use language that matches the job post, they understand exactly:</p>
      <p>“Oh yeah, s/he would be able to fulfill requirements X, Y and Z.”</p>
      <p>That means you’ll get more interviews.</p>
      <p>That means you’ll be in demand.</p>
      <p>That means you’ll be offered more money.</p>
      <h3>Tip #4: Using specific detailed bullet points that are quantified.</h3>

      <p>If you aren’t in the habit of doing this, it will take work to start doing it.</p>
      <p>But…</p>
      <p>It will be well worth the effort.</p>
      <p>Don’t say: “Reduced call time from the database.”</p>
      <p>
        Do say: “Reduced call time from the database by 37% by decreasing read algorithms from
        O(nlogn) to O(n).”
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t say: “Decreased page load speed by converting to Tailwind, yielding a decrease in the
        bounce rate.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Do say: “Decreased page load speed by 48% by converting from CSS to Tailwind, yielding a 26%
        decrease in the bounce rate.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to Tip #2, the issue is that the vague option leaves recruiters to fill in the
        blanks themselves.
      </p>
      <p>(And they don’t fill them in. Because it would take effort and require presumptions.)</p>
      <p>
        By telling them specifically, quantifiably, what you changed during your previous roles, you
        go from…
      </p>
      <p>“Meh, not sure what this means.”</p>
      <p>To…</p>
      <p>“Wow, that would be such an improvement here.”</p>
      <p class="font-bold">These tips work and work well.</p>
      <p class="font-bold">Applying them will get you a better response rate immediately.</p>
      <p class="font-bold">
        But you’ll get far further by investing in getting the full Headhunter treatment.
