    <p>

        <p>You’ll leave your peers and colleagues in the industry in the dust monetarily.</p>

        <p>How?</p>

        <p>
          By following a set of proven methods and techniques that hundreds of recruiters could tell
          you about…
        </p>

        <p>But none will.</p>

        <p>
          Because improving your job hunting and negotiation abilities would be bad for their
          clients, they don’t want you to improve.
        </p>

        <p class="underline">
          In fact, recruiters and employers celebrate giving employees the short end of the stick in
          salary negotiations.
        </p>

        <p>However, I’m here to help.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to continue as an underpaid, undervalued member of your team for the rest
          of your career.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to disappoint yourself, year after year, by failing to secure a raise from
          your employer.
        </p>

        <p>Or by avoiding the discussion entirely.</p>

        <p>
          The difficulty in securing a raise is not your doing. Society rigs the game against you,
          and the only place you have to turn to for advice is the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>Yet the Internet isn’t always helpful!</p>

          Look how many people on Reddit have the same problem getting paid what they’re worth:
        </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        // todo: [ todo: insert gif]

        <p>If advice on this topic is so common, why does the question come up over and over?</p>

        <p>
          Shouldn’t Redditors be able to solve this so well that the search function is all anyone
          needs?
        </p>

        <p>Here’s typical Redditor advice you’ll receive about what to do when you’re underpaid:</p>

        <!-- // todo: insert image -->
        <p>The advice shows up again in this thread:</p>
        <!-- // todo: insert image -->

        <p>
          The reason this advice shows up so often is that it works. But even when people apply,
          they often come up short. Job hunting and interview skills often need work.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can’t find better job offers if you can’t get to the interview stage… or make
          interviewers love you as a candidate.
        </p>

        <p>Here’s another redditor echoing this same truth:</p>

        <!-- // todo: insert image -->
        <p>
          And yet another who recommends interviewing with other companies to find out what you’re
          worth:
        </p>
        <!-- // todo: insert image -->

        <p>Yet none of these posts address the glaring, valley-wide room for improvement:</p>

        <p>Your job hunting and interview skills.</p>

        <p>If they’re weak, you’ll end up with the same low pay as you had before.</p>

        <p>And nothing will change.</p>

        <p>
          You feel undervalued and know it’s true. You find yourself pinching pennies when you never
          thought you’d have to. Friends and people on forums say your pay should be higher. You
          want to be the type of person who can brag and help others get ahead. But you don’t know
          how to make a change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worse, you worry that the difficulties finding a job aren’t just about the resumes you’re
          sending out, but about you personally. You worry that you’re going to be undervalued at
          your role forever. Decades of it.

        <p>Your friends at other companies wish they knew your secret.</p>

        <p>
          You post a yearly “here’s my TC” and find yourself leading the pack on Team Blind. You
          offer advice to people who are in your past position. (And it’s a referral to my program.)
        </p>
